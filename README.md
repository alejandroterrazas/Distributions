## Statistical Distributions in SciPy Stats

This is a collection of foundational statistical distributions using SciPy Stats.  These distributions are part of the introductory materials for my Machine Learning/Data Science course.

To experiment with the distributions, load the Jupyter Notebook Distributions.ipynb and try the different options with the distributions that are included so far.  Additional distributions will be added over time.  To date, I have:

1. Uniform
2. Normal (Gaussian)
3. Binomial
4. Bernoulli
5. Beta
6. Gamma
7. Poisson
